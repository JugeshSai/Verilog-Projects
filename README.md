# Verilog Projects Repository

This repository is a collection of my **Verilog HDL projects**, built as part of my continuous learning and digital design development.  
These projects explore everything from logic fundamentals to complete FPGA-based systems.

## ✅ Completed Projects

### 📟 1. 24-Hour Digital Clock Design
**Description**:  
A mini project implemented using Verilog that displays real-time in 24-hour format (HH:MM:SS) on a 4-digit 7-segment display using multiplexing logic.

**Features**:
- Displays hours and minutes (seconds maintained internally for time accuracy)
- Uses 1 Hz clock for time counting
- Digit multiplexing using a counter and refresh technique
- Asynchronous reset
- Target FPGA: **Artix-7 (Invent Logics Edge Board)**

**Modules Included**:
- Clock Divider (50 MHz ➝ 1 Hz & 500 Hz)
- BCD Time Counter (HH:MM with internal seconds)
- 7-Segment Display Encoder
- Multiplexed Display Driver Logic
